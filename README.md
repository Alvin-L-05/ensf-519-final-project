# ensf-519-final-project

The Images folder even when zipped is too large. Get the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k

Downloading the dataset should give you a zip file called "archive", unzip it and you should see the "Images" folder and the "captions.txt" file. I already added the .txt file to the repo so all you need is the Images folder in the same directory as the project .ipynb file.
